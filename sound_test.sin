## Settings for sound

# Tone
# ----
# tone:     Number for tone
# amp:      Amplitude for tone, from 0 to 127
# phase:    phase of the tone, from 0 to 360
# pan:      from -127 to 127
# pitch:    option for pitch of the tone, two arguments
#           harm   - harmonic, for example 1 is 1st harmonic (c), and 3/2 = 1.5 is the fifth (g),
#           offset - offset in hz from pressed key, 17/16 or 1,0625
#           const  - offset in hz, which does not move relative to pressed key

tone: 0, amp: 127, phase: 0, pan: 0, pitch: harm 3/2
tone: 1, amp: 100, phase: 45, pan: 50, pitch: offset 100.5
tone: 2, amp: 50, phase: 90, pan: -50, pitch: const 512
